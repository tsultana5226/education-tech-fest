                    <p>A charter school is a tuition-free school of choice that is publicly funded but independently run. Charter schools do not draw students from an assigned area; families choose to send their children to them. If demand for enrollment
                     in a charter school exceeds space, students are usually picked by a random lottery. Charters are generally viewed under state laws as public schools whose students are required to take all the same assessments as those who attend
                     traditional district schools.</p>

                    <p>Everyone must apply to high schools even if you live in one the few remaining areas in the city that still has a zoned high school. The year-long admissions process begins at the end of 7th grade, when children bring home a 500+ page
                       high school directory. This huge directory lists more than 400 schools, many containing multiple programs from which you can choose. The Department of Education holds high school information sessions over the summer to walk you
                       through the process. To apply, students must complete and submit the citywide high school application, where they may list up to to 12 schools, ranked in the order of their preference. The application deadline is in early December.
                       Students find out their high school placement in March.Some schools, called screened schools, require high grades and good attendance records</p>

                    <p>Magnet programs and schools are designed by local authorities to attract parents, guardians, and students who are free to choose, subject to local rules, the school in which they enroll. These programs and schools are established by
                       district Governing Boards. A Governing Board can make a wide range of choices depending upon the needs, demands, board purposes, and available funding. Magnet schools and programs include those that provide unique instruction in
                       the arts, in various sciences, and in career education. Others reflect a district strategy to achieve racial and ethnic balance, generally with the benefit of federal funding. When one or more magnets are established at a particular
                       school, students from across the district may select the magnet subject to available space.</p>
