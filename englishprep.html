            <p>Read the passage and answer the following questions.</p>
            <p>The Year without a Summer</p>
            <p>
            The eruption of the Philippine volcano Mount Pinatubo in June 1991 sent a huge cloud of gas and dust
            encircling the globe. The dust and ash from Mount Pinatubo was blamed for a two-year decrease in
            global temperature, changes in weather patterns, and damage to the ozone layer. The situation brings
            to mind a time now remembered as "The Year without a Summer," a meteorological event that
            occurred 175 years earlier. At that time, harsh weather conditions plagued much of eastern North
            America and, to a lesser extent, northern Europe.
            April 1816 brought typical spring weather to upstate New York and New England; trees budded, and
            farmers prepared to plow and plant. In May, however, the expected warm temperatures failed to
            arrive. Most people remained optimistic, waiting for the summer that was "just around the corner."
            They waited in vain. During the first week of June, ten inches of snow fell on New England.
            Throughout the month, temperatures rarely rose above the 30s. Many farmers replanted crops several
            times, only to see them stunted or destroyed by sleet, hail, and icy winds. July and August brought
            little improvement. During most days the temperature stayed in the 40s. Farmers' diaries document
            the farmers' daily struggles with near-freezing temperatures, failing crops, and dying farm animals.
            The few crops that managed to survive were killed by frost in mid-September. Winter came early in
            New England and was unusually severe. Even the South was affected; on July 4, the high temperature
            for Savannah, Georgia, was only 46 degrees Fahrenheit!
            Some religious leaders warned their congregations that the unusual weather meant that the end of
            the world was drawing near. Other leaders attributed the cool weather to unusual sunspot activity.
            The proliferation of the newly invented lightning rod was also blamed as some people believed that
            lightning rods had interrupted the natural temperature balance of Earth, causing the cooler
            temperatures.
            It was not until October that the first plausible explanation for "The Year without a Summer" was
            suggested. Friedrich Bessel, a German astronomer, reported seeing thick clouds of dust in the upper
            atmosphere. He theorized that these dust particles screened portions of Earth from the warming rays
            of the sun. It was discovered that in April 1815, Mount Tambora, an Indonesian volcano, had erupted
            with such force that it had sent an estimated 100 cubic miles of fine dust into the atmosphere.
            Witnesses to the eruption reported that the sky remained dark for two days. The dust then rose high
            into the stratosphere, where it encircled the world for several years to come.
            Skeptics in 1816 doubted that a faraway volcano could steal their summer. However, most present-day
            researchers believe Bessel's explanation to be generally correct, demonstrating the global nature of
            weather. The dust in the atmosphere eventually settled, and the spring of 1817 was back to normal.</p>

            <p>2. Which of the following best tells what this passage is about?</p>
            <p>A. the belief of some religious leaders that the end of the world was coming in 1816</p>
            <p>B. a summer of strange weather and its probable cause</p>
            <p>C. the importance of summer weather to agriculture in New England</p>
            <p>D. a comparison of the weather of 1816 and 1991</p>

            <br>
            <p>3. What is the most likely reason farmers persisted in replanting their crops?</p>
            <p>A. They believed that the cold weather could not continue all summer long.</p>
            <p>B. They thought that crops would be able to survive even though the weather remained cold.</p>
            <p>C. They believed that the improved weather conditions of July would last.</p>
            <p>D. They thought the June snowfalls would provide needed moisture.</p>

            <br>
            <p>4. In the winter that followed the summer of 1816, New Englanders most likely experienced</p>
            <p>A. new weather events that they had not encountered before.</p>
            <p>B. temperatures that were warmer than usual for that time of year</p>
            <p>C. shortages of fruits, vegetables, and other essential crops.</p>
            <p>D. difficulty adjusting to a different timeline for planting crops.</p>

            <p>5. How does paragraph 3 contribute to the passage?</p>
            <p>A. It presents the most probable cause of the 1816 weather.</p>
            <p>B. It shows how nineteenth-century people explained the 1816 weather.</p>
            <p>C. It presents a theory about the 1816 weather that some skeptics doubted.</p>
            <p>D. It includes eyewitness reports to describe the source of the 1816 weather</p>
