            <h2>Applying To Schools</h2>
            <p> High school applications are given out to 8th graders each fall. Here are a few strategies for submitting a strong application.

Start exploring schools and programs the summer between 7th and 8th grade. Find places where you think you might be happy. Looking at 20 to 30 programs is a good starting point.
Consider your chances of getting an offer. Balance your application between schools that are a “reach” for you and target schools or programs that seem like a strong match. Learn more about your chances of a match in the NYC High School Directory.
List 12 programs on your Round 1 Application—in order of preference.
Submit your completed application by the due date, usually early December of each year.</p>
